## Introduction

- This  repository contains my `OOP` work one years ago.

- The first one is an intelligent multi-thread lift program.

- The second one is a Railway-System which supports some queries, including least ticket price and least distance, for the customer.

- The third one is a `UML-PARSER`. For more details, you could go through the directory to see my project.

## Apology

> There would be tough for me to translate all my work into English-Version. So most of my work and introductions are written in Chinese.
